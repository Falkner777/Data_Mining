# Data_Mining
A data-mining related project consisting of two parts.

## Part A
Given the energy demands of the state of California as well as the sources providing the energy for the span of 3 years we were asked to perform data cleaning
techniques and basic statistic analysis. We also had to find specific patterns in the data, remove days-outliers, perform clustering as well as train a Recursive
Neural Network with LSTM cells in order to predict the demand in the future based on past data.

## Part B
Given an amazon product review dataset, with NLP and Word Embeddings techniques we were required to clean the data, convert then into float vectors in order for the
Random Forest Classifer to be able to train.
